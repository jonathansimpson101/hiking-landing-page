I had two main aims for this project.

Number 1: Overlay content on top of a video background.
Number 2: Use grid to create a collage of images of all different shapes and sizes.

I'm really happy that I managed to complete both of these. It been valuable learning!

Points to improve:

- Still not finding it easy to make responsive at phone level, although ipad and large screen is OK.
- Need more practice with bootstrap - particuarly carousels.
